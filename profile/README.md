# Sensor Lab Project for Efficient Attendance Management

Welcome to our GitHub organization! We are a team of four developers who collaborated on building the Sensor Lab Project, which consists of the following repositories:

1. [Attendance App Flutter](https://github.com/SEM-6-MP2-0/Attendence-App)
2. [RFID Server (NodeJS)](https://github.com/SEM-6-MP2-0/RFID_Server)
3. [RFID Raspberry Server (Python)](https://github.com/SEM-6-MP2-0/RFID_Raspberry_Server)

Our project is aimed at utilizing RFID technology for attendance tracking in a college setting, and we believe that our code will be useful to other educational institutions looking to implement similar systems.

## Attendance App Flutter

The Attendance App is a mobile application developed using Flutter. It allows students to scan their RFID tags to mark their attendance for classes or events. The app also includes a real-time dashboard that displays attendance statistics and allows instructors to manage classes and students. The Attendance App is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a modern and clean user interface.

## RFID Server (NodeJS)

The RFID Server is the central component of our Sensor Lab Project. It is responsible for managing the database of student and class information, processing attendance data, and communicating with the RFID Raspberry Server. The RFID Server is written in NodeJS and is designed to be scalable and flexible, capable of handling large amounts of data and supporting multiple concurrent users.

## RFID Raspberry Server (Python)

The RFID Raspberry Server is the hardware component of our Sensor Lab Project. It is a Raspberry Pi device equipped with an RFID reader that is used to scan RFID tags and communicate with the RFID Server. The RFID Raspberry Server is written in Python and is designed to be lightweight and energy-efficient, while still capable of handling the high data rates required for real-time attendance tracking.

## Demo Video

We have prepared a demo video that showcases the functionality of our Sensor Lab Project. You can view the video by clicking on the link below:

## Getting Started

To get started with any of our repositories, simply clone the repository to your local machine and follow the instructions in the README file for that repository. We welcome contributions from the open source community and encourage you to submit pull requests or issues as needed.

Thank you for your interest in our Sensor Lab Project and we hope that our code will be helpful to other educational institutions looking to streamline their attendance management processes.
